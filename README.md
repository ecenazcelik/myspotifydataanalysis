My Spotify Data Analysis
About the Project:
This project explores personal Spotify listening data to uncover insights into musical preferences and listening habits. It's an engaging journey through the world of music analytics, leveraging the Spotify API to fetch data and employing Python programming skills for data manipulation and visualization.

My Hypothesis:
The prevailing moods reflected in the audio features of my frequently played tracks, along with the influence of globally viral songs, are significant determinants of my music taste.

There is a quantifiable correlation between the audio features of tracks that I frequently listen to and my emotional state or mood. Concurrently, there is an observable trend where my music preference aligns with the attributes of songs that are globally recognized as 'viral' or 'trending'. The combination of these factors forms the basis of my music taste.
A preference for tracks with specific audio features during different times of the day or week, indicating mood-based music selection.
A significant overlap between my frequently played tracks and songs featured in global viral charts, suggesting external influence on music choice.



Website:
You can wisit the project website by downloading Spotify_Analysis.py file and run it on your terminal by streamlit run Spotify_Analysis.py in the location of the file. Note: You need to install necessary librarys such as matplotlib etc. (You can run the .ipynb code to see the widgets as well)

Motivation:
The motivation behind this project is to understand personal music listening patterns. By analyzing data from Spotify, I aim to gain a deeper appreciation of my musical tastes and how they evolve over time. This project also serves as an excellent practice ground for honing skills in Python, data analysis, and the use of Spotify's Web API.

Data Source:
Data for this analysis is sourced from the Spotify Web API. The Spotipy Python library simplifies the process of fetching data such as top artists, tracks, genres, and listening trends over various time frames.

Analysis Overview:
The project includes several analytical components:

API Data Fetching: Retrieving personal Spotify data.
Data Aggregation and Transformation: Organizing data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Investigating basic patterns and trends.
In-depth Analysis: Delving into genre trends, artist preferences, and listening habits.
Visualization: Using Matplotlib for graphical representation of data.

Key Findings:
The analysis provides insights into personal music preferences, identifying favorite genres, artists, and how these choices vary over time. It also offers an understanding of how my listening habits align with or differ from global music trends.

Limitations and Future Work:
Future enhancements include expanding data sources, integrating other music services, and exploring the social aspects of music listening, like comparing tastes with friends or other users.

Technologies Used:
Python
Spotify Web API
Spotipy
